              Welcome to the world of Teothe, a universe of darkness and light, where planetary planes and endless possibilities intertwine. Once, the Astral Sea was reformed, and the gods favored their divinity upon the land, leading the people to prosper and thrive. Adventurers formed groups and traversed other nations, sparking cultural renaissances across history, religion, politics, and technology. The people reached such heights that they questioned the necessity of the gods themselves. With waning faith, the gods starved, and to prevent their demise, domains united. But as different philosophies collided, warped concepts merged, and the ties between planes were severed, setting the cogs of fate into motion.

              During this tumultuous era, the world witnessed the catastrophic 'Corrosion of Rods', an event that saw the clash of the Underworld and Overworld forces. In the aftermath of this clash, the divine rods that once connected the Material Planes were shattered, and the remnants formed a mysterious 'Divine Curtain' that now veils the material realms.

              Amidst the turmoil, the last incomprehensible Ancient artifact, which had long stood atop Teothe's desert, vanished into nothingness, leading the magic-affiliated mourn the loss of the opportunity to grasp the past's inherited knowledge.
