              text: [
                "**The implications of fantasy grounded in memories of a short-lived race, a review of literature: 3 rd chair of Konark, Alvelon Mudrunissa**",
                "There was once a brave druid adventurer named Steram. He met other brave adventurers on the way, some dead, some alive, and some a brick in the sad, sad wall.",
                "An ancient scammer with a different name for each victim cried a call. In exchange for blessings lost to time, Steram answered without obligation.",
                "**Mentioned ancient scammer has stirred the land previously in 11th of Fexyius, 48 AC. There were folk with ethereal branding in their extremities, and most ended up being executed.**",
                "In due time, Steram accomplished the bidding of providing weave. Opening these ancient gates proved difficult. To no avail, language, power, and time have all proved to be barriers, yet Steram bested his foes. The final half-ancient has prevailed.",
                "**There is no concrete proof of Steram Wayogo being related to ancients, besides some records of him mentioning a different type of weave once experienced in the Fireward, Elkian desert, and his lifespan. These can be accomplished by study, or foreign magic, most explored by the Headmage Sivirron Paracix.**",
                "This ancient scammer also succeeded in their dark goals. The damage was done by the last demigoddess since the vocal collapse, Steram, and the one with bugs. With the writings found within the gates, passages towards the dark beneath, the divine showed the way to recovery. A way to make amends. One was to bring life, one was to punish life, and one was to seal the gateways.",
                "**Proof for this demigoddess being the lost daughter of old House Archambeau, Eve, exists; thus stating the divine demanded repentance.**",
                "The demigoddess ascended, bugs spread, Steram departed. Through rubble, fire, and flames, almost drowned and crushed under this divine responsibility… Steram walked. Steram ran. Steram swam. Steram saw the World Tree, and Steram caressed. Nothing stood in his way and salvation.",
                "**Bog Voor, a druid colleague of Elkia that had the chance to visit confirm this in their journal. A guess; Steram travelled for up to 2417 years and returned from the same point they embarked, around 1 Red.**",
                "Without the slightest crumb of hesitation, taking a half-ancient’s time, he sealed the weave.",
                "In the tales of achievements, it was recounted that a gate atop an icy mountain played a significant role. Steram, with keen intellect and resourcefulness, devised a plan to ascend the treacherous peak. Utilizing mystical abilities, Steram conjured small flames that danced before his claws. Employing these as tools, Steram skillfully navigated the icy terrain, melting the ice and rendering it passable. Thus, he ascended the mountain without a sweat, triumphing over the formidable obstacle.",
                "**This is probably why Tortle’s of Kirame have lanterns shaped like claws. Their culture is grounds for more research.**",
                "In the realm of magical tales, an extraordinary gate materialized before his eyes, suspended amidst the vast expanse of the open sea. Harnessing the power of shaping water, Steram cleared a path, guiding his way towards the enigmatic floating isle. Utilizing his inherent abilities(1), he fostered the growth of vibrant vegetation, a testament to his command over the natural world. From the depths of the sea to the elevated realm of this gate, Steram persevered, ascending towards his objective.",
                "**(1)These inherent abilities aren’t of a druid’s. Many have confirmed having similar capabilities, yet records refer to this as Steram’s ancientry, contradicting other proofs of his lineage. Moreover, Steram Wayogo was a Tortle.**",
                "However, just as he approached the gate to seal it shut, a colossal red dragon(2) emerged from the depths, engulfed in a surge of anger. The fearsome creature beheld Steram standing defiantly before the gate and launched a fierce attack. The two adversaries engaged in a relentless battle that persisted throughout the entire day. Steram later recounted the intense struggle, expressing unwavering determination and confidence in his victory. Alas, as the sun descended beneath the horizon, an unexpected turn of events transpired.",
                "**(2)Probably a winged siren, or intelligent anomaly.**",
                "To Steram's astonishment, the dragon's savage roars transformed into discernible speech. The dragon revealed that he had misunderstood Steram's intentions, believing him to be yet another intruder. A voice filled with remorse and longing for his fallen comrade, the dragon, known as ██████ acknowledged Steram's unparalleled strength. ██████ sought vengeance against the culprits who had unlocked the gate using the blood of the half-ancients, leading to his comrade's demise. Thus, ██████ had secluded himself within the depths of the sea.",
                "Recognizing the miscommunication that had fuelled their clash, Steram halted his offensive and approached the perplexed dragon with words of explanation. He clarified his purpose: to seal the gate and prevent any further breaches. Assuring ██████ of his genuine intentions, Steram beseeched the dragon for an opportunity to demonstrate his true mission. Though initially sceptical, the dragon, yearning for resolution, granted Steram the chance to proceed.",
                "As Steram diligently worked to close the gate, his actions spoke louder than any words. Witnessing the gate's gradual sealing, ██████’s animosity dissolved, replaced by a newfound alliance. A heartfelt conversation ensued between the unlikely comrades, as ██████ shared the tragic loss of his companion during the previous incursion. Unable to prevent the opening in time, ██████ harboured immense guilt, withdrawing to the solace of his aquatic abode. ",
                "**The prevailing theme across these texts is the portrayal of heroism and the exploration of the hero's journey, often intertwined with elements of prophecy and destiny. There is no reason to think this is a lie by the author.**",
                "In a realm engulfed by the scorching embrace of a plane of fire, a remarkable feat unfolded through the valiant actions of Steram. Confronted with a formidable gate that perpetually blazed with unrelenting flames, Steram devised a daring strategy. Recognizing the need to protect himself from the searing heat, he summoned a localized rain shower, skillfully manipulating the elements to shield his own presence.",
                "Undeterred by the raging inferno, Steram orchestrated a bold manoeuvre. Droplets of water cascaded from above, converging upon the gate, as he meticulously harnessed the power of shaping water. Through his arcane command, the water transformed into ice, countering the relentless fire that engulfed the gate. Amidst the fiery maelstrom, Steram discerned the unyielding fury of the flames beneath his feet, yet he remained impervious to their wrath.",
                "Steram left a deliberate aperture, permitting him the opportunity to accomplish his ultimate objective: the closure of the gate. Through sheer determination and unwavering focus, he manoeuvred past the relentless assault of the flames, resolute in his mission to seal the gateway. The unyielding rage of the conflagration roared beneath him, but Steram remained unscathed, fortified by his unyielding resolve.",
                "This extraordinary tale of Steram, his resilience and strategic brilliance, his triumph over an ancient scam and his successful sealing of the weave, ensures lessons of containment.",
                "**This body of literature sheds light on the intricate connections between ancient magic systems and their cultural significance within fantastical societies. A central focus of this work is the exploration of elemental magic and its representation as a force intrinsic to the natural world, often mirroring the delicate balance of power.**",
                "A quote to all readers from the last half-ancient: 'Beware of the future as I had no time to seal either the maggot or the master.'",
                "**By delving into the vast array of texts, we uncover the narrative tapestries that weave together the threads of destiny, often intertwined with the enigmatic origins and purpose of the halfancients, beings caught between the realms of mortals and immortals. Examining the portrayal of half-ancients across various fantasy works, we uncover the underlying mythos surrounding their existence, exploring their relationships with mortal beings and the ethereal forces that govern their actions. Amidst the veils of time and forgotten lore, a missing information lies, a key to unravel the ancient enigma that shall shape the destiny of realms untold. After all, it is accurate that Steram, a protagonist whose struggles were unmatched, traversed the treacherous realms of despair, facing adversaries and perils that dared to challenge his unwavering spirit. Thanks to him, albeit many unaware, we are still here.**",
