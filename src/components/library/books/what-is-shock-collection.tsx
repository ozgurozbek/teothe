What is Shock Collection
By Patrick Goldgrain
An Unfortunate Propaganda
Co-Authored by Sera & Isaac
What is Shock? - Part I
For starters, I would like to introduce myself. I am
the all-known but not all-knowing alchemist Lord
Patrick Goldgrain. My family has been the
owners of the great Goldgrain Farms for
hundreds of years and they have always been
beloved by the people who work under them
because of their generosity. I studied alchemy
and learned magic growing up. My father was my
first mentor and then I have traveled to the great
libraries of the World and spent a fortune to
order books or to get them translated. All my
research has been done by me and the people
who work for me. We have been on this project
for the last 23 years and I have decided to make
a fair amount of this information public
knowledge.
To understand Shock, we must first understand
the humanoid body. We have blood in our veins
that carry life to our organs. Blood travels
through veins and finds the organ it needs to
feed. Later the blood is returned through a
different vein to the starting point and it
completes a full tour.
The same thing goes for Shock. Shock can run
through metallic “veins” in order to reach
“organs”. Organs in this subject are almost all
alive creatures and some objects. Shock enters
the system or the item, runs through it, and then
gets out using another canal. It is not as easy to
see Shock leave through a different canal for 2
reasons:
 1. Shock moves way too fast so watching it
happen doesn't give us the insight we need.
 2. Shock Particles are smaller than Blood
Particles so the width of the canal Shock requires
is significantly smaller.
If you don't want something alive to not be
affected by Shock here is some ways you can do
that:
 1. Infuse armor with lightning resistance -or if
you are rich enough lightning immunity!
 2. Get a big wood shield and protect yourself
with it. No metal parts to not let Shock possess
your shield. No thin-leather or easily flammable
wood either because Shock also heats the
material it's engaged with -we don't know why,
but it is an usable properyty!
 3. If you have rubber where you live, you can
get it in a glass shape and put it on top of the
source of Shock. Rubber is the greatest way to
stop Shock. If you are interested in rubberenhanced armor you can always visit the
Goldgrain Manor and see the blacksmith. It is
pricy, but we have tested it against level 4-5
lightning spells and our pet lightning elemental
Wiffy.
 4. If you want to isolate a structure in a way
that Shock cannot get past it, you also have to
consider the heat. The best option for priceefficiency is concrete.
Now that we have settled who I am and how to
protect ourselves from lethal doses of Shock, we
can start talking about its chemistry.
Shock is a resource just like food, water, daylight,
weave, and the pulling force under Teothe. (For
detailed information about the pulling force see
the book: GRAVITING IT ALL). We can use this
resource once we shape it. Just like we need to
chew the food in order to shape it. The best way
to transform Shock through a canal is to use a
copper-gold mixture. To discriminate against any
chance of leaks you need to also cover it with
rubber. This also helps with protecting your
copper-gold mixture. You dig a canal about 1 in
100 compared to a water canal, put the rubber,
copper-gold, and then rubber again. Like a
rubber-copper sandwich with rubber as the
bread and the copper-gold as the Goldgrain Deer
Tenderloin cooked over low-heat for 14 hours
and then smoked with carrots and potatoes.
Unlike a sandwich, you have to cover all sides to
make the isolation work.
Shock as a resource is more useful than most
workers. It can turn something way faster than a
human with high dexterity and can smash
something way stronger than an orc. To see my
crafts that ease daily life and are cost-efficient in
long term, visit the Goldgrain Manor. I also offer
accomodation support for a reasonable price.
One of the best ways I have found to use Shock
is either to reflect it on a strong metal and use
the metal surface's heat. Be careful to not touch
it through something that carries Shock. If you
want the full list of things that reflect Shock or
carry it, You can visit the library in Goldgrain
Manor.
One more way to consider using Shock is
something that is still under research but is
showing great possibilities. If you manage to
make a really thin copper in a form of a chain and
then put it in really small glass pieces, you can
use it as a bright light resource. At least
24,567452034 times brighter than the average
Goldgrain Candle!
For more information about Shock and how it
can be used, or if you are a sage interested in this,
you can visit the Goldgrain Manor.
What is Shock? - Part II
To understand references and subjects in this
book, you must first read “What is Shock? - Part
I”
In the last book I have mentioned who I am but
in case some people skipped the first book or
that part of the book I'll have to introduce myself
again. I am Lord Patrick Goldgrain. Lord of the
Famous Goldgrain Farms and the mighty
Goldgrain Manor. My forefathers have been the
Lord of Goldgrain for decades and everyone that
has been in our presence left with joy.
Me and my work has gotten a lot of attention
which I think is caused by my ability as a
wordsmith. We Goldgrains have it in our blood to
be a true talent in any form of art we decide. I
have a lot more sages and wizards working for
my research so please stop asking to be a part of
it. I will let everyone know when we are in need
of more people.
I am glad to say the research for Shock-based
lamps instead of flaming ones has been complete.
For pricing of Shock systems and different
strengths of shock lamps visit the Market of Light
in Goldgrain -Not the one in Greyland, that one
is run by paladins
What I previously called the "Shock Heat" is now
called Juul Heating. Named after my cat that died
from it. May she rest in peace.
We have done some blocks filled with metal
parts that carry Shock and keep them in the
designated area for a long time. With this, you
can use Shock as a source of heat without the
worry of getting lightning damage. The whole
thing is way too heavy so we suggest you send a
letter of order. It is 6KGP and every week it
carried by a cart is 0.7KGP. You have the right to
carry it to your spot yourself, but if it breaks on
the way we won't pay you back.
We have opened a factory in Dwarven Union
because it is cheaper to find the metal and find
the people to Smith it there. We travel it by sea
and pay a ton of taxes so everything is more
expensive now. This is a sacrifice all humanity has
to make because results show that we are
producing at least 3 times the normal amount. So
it makes sense that the prices are 4 times the
normal amount as well.
I think this is a good opportunity to reach out to
Winston's Fleet. The rock gnome we have been
in contact with is no longer taxing us. We have to
explain what we do and the pricing again. We
would like the rock gnome named Mermaid back
on the business so things can run smoothly. We
have no intention of not paying our part but we
would like to not have to explain our cargo every
run.
Neighbouring lands to Goldgrain, namely
Greenland, Greenreach, Goldreach and, Jyortt
have been purchased by me, one and only Lord
Patrick Goldgrain. I have turbines working to
transform other sources of energy into Shock in
order to experiment more with it. I had to talk
about this not only to show my success but also
to stop the worrying commons who think
something underground is coming up with its
claws.
We have also made a Shock-Castle next to the
great Goldgrain Manor (which is next to the old
Goldgrain Manor). It has an entire floor to make
things cold. Really cold. Putting things
underground only makes them a little cold. This
is really really cold. We have put a hundred men
worth of deer meat and we are testing if the
meat is still good to eat every month since it's
done. 7 months in and it is still as tasty as day one.
It is safe to assume this is about the Goldgrain
Deer Meat which you can buy over at Goldgrain
Farms for a reasonable price.
We have some clerics who are able to perform
sending, working with some wizards and
alchemists to make a sending-machine. This is
still at an early stage but our target is to place
one in every city in every kingdom. This way you
can do sending to anywhere in Teothe for a
reasonable price even without needing a cleric!
What is Shock? – Part III
As you all know I am Lord Patrick Goldgrain and I
strongly advise you to read the following books
first: What is Shock? – Part I & What is Shock? –
Part II
I am proud to announce that I have purchased
more of our neighbours. I won't be giving names
this time since I will be obtaining even more. I
also purchased a place near Hephai just because
it was called Graingold. There is a teleportation
circle to Goldgrain from there for 200GP only!
Previously some people accidentally went there,
and it turned out to be a bother. Just to think
how many Goldgrain Quality Deer Ribeyes with
Goldgrain Quality Grain were missed by these
poor men.
If you have bought our previous books and our
creations, this is going to be great news for you;
We now sell Shock. Not in containers or in bottles
even though we are also working on that. We sell
Shock wherever you are. Just purchase a call
from your city's town at the electro-sender to
Goldgrain Shock Institution and our team will
arrive at your address, set you a Shock farm,
harvesting the sun! We also let you use it as
much as you want for a reasonable price.
We have also moved to the whole of Goldgrain
Estate to its respective plane, currently being
held by the sorcerer Lord Bob Goldgrain, so you'll
need the teleportation circle in Hephai to make
your way here.
Unfortunately, we have no service to Akairo and
Kheranthe, nor there will be because our
couriers have been attacked by numerous
entities, over and over again. I also have a new
set of rules to sell my services and the full list of
rules is as follows:
 Your purchases should add up to 10KGP at a
time. Any trade less than that will not be
considered.
 You have to have a royal title in order to
purchase anything.
 To have your services delivered, you must first
ransom 10KGP to any courier of your choosing,
and it has to be delivered.
 To use (or see) electro-senders you should first
purchase a yearly subscription for only 400GP.
 Anyone that has been a citizen of Akairo in the
last 10 years or anyone that has lived there
 longer than 5 years should report this
information before any purchase, if I find it out
with my resources I will not be paying you a
refund.
Now knowing all these are out of the way, I can
explain the procedure to create Shock at your
place and why you should buy it;
Similar to what I said in Part I, Shock is a form of
energy no different than food or weave. To get
the energy from food, you have to have the right
set of organs to consume and transform it and
the same goes for weave. Since most structures
cannot bend weave or eat food, Shock and steam
pressure are the best options. Steam is a tricky
material to use and even the smallest flaw in the
machinery causes the system to fail. Unlike
steam, Shock systems usually are not as fragile,
and if something goes out of the way the worst
thing that can happen is the worker carrying it
frying in a few seconds. I have done the math and
it is cheaper to pay the family than to be careful
enough to prevent it.
The first and the most suggested method we use
to obtain Shock is to use windmills, with friction
machines instead of the mill. If your castle is on
high ground, this is even more effective. We
build the shock barrels and the turbines for a
reasonable price and for another reasonable
price we let you hire a guy who can run it. Race
is optional, we have most of them.
Another method, for castles in odd places, is to
use a friction machine powered by steam.
Friction causes Shock when both materials are fit.
My advisors told me to get the names of said
materials out in order to prevent fake copies or
homemade ones. It takes significantly less space
and creates a decent amount of Shock. If steam
is also a problem at your castle, you can set 2 of
your workers on the bicycle part of the machine.
Their energy will be stored as Shock.
Lastly and highly experimental is shock shields.
We set a shield that stores any shock energy that
is engaging it. You can have your wizard struck it
with lightning or something similar whenever
you need to store some more. (no spell higher
than level 6)
It is also worth mentioning that I have decided to
sell a limited amount of these each year in order
to make it a treat to those who have it. It would
be a nightmare if every castle or even every
home had its own Shock. The first set of
machinery of the year is the cheapest. Every
machinery sold increases the price of the next
one by 25GP permanently. I had to take this
precaution to keep it as unpopular as possible so
we, deserving rich, can enjoy our specialness.
Also to read Part IV and possibly more, you need
to come to visit Goldgrain in winter and get in
line once it's released. Or we can deliver it to you
via a courier if you already have the Goldgrain
Shock services for a reasonable price. Parts
beyond this won't be released publicly, since
we'll dive in business expansion with
infrastructure.
