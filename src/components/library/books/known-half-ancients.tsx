`All of these are written based on rumors and
even if they are true most of these entities
probably don't want to be encountered by
adventurers. Just a reminder.
Harutya: Most famous one. Travels between
cities looking for odds and ends. Most cities
banned her because she is half ancient. She
camps outside cities and since folk is always
interested in her she can manage to do some
trade.
Azdial The Leg Chopper: Crazed with the fact
that he cannot die, he isolated himself in some
unknown place, some state in a plane called
Thaum, little people come across him and none
leave with their legs intact.
Hemhapius: Jumped into a volcano and lost his
non-ancient body parts. The way he looks is
disturbing even for the undead. It's believed that
he has been into machinery for the last few
hundred years and dungeons before that. He
leaves light-made artifacts in machinery
dungeons. Artifacts are so out of this world, it's
no doubt that some ancient has done it.
Akalea: Great Faith Healer. Only appears when a
newborn child is ill. Sometimes even before the
family knows the child is sick. These children live
2-3 times their normal lifespan. Most of them
organize with each other to heal and save people.
It's said Akalea has a book covered with blinding
light and the only way to understand the
knowledge inside is to be blinded by the book
and then healed by Akalea herself.
Rothareron: Sets sail to the toughest seas in
many planes because he has sworn a warrior's
death. While he is recruiting for his crew he pays
the family instead. Making it clear that the crew
will never come back. Most recruits are tough
criminals from prison or exile.
Maggot Eater: Most believe that this is a myth.
No real name is known. Goes after dragon-sized
prey and kills them. Then talks to them until their
body is covered with maggots. Feasts on the
maggots and goes for his next prey. Even though
in many places of the world, large and hostile
prey with nothing but bones are found. Anyone
who has encountered his work says that it was
made by him without a moment's hesitation.
Gurroka: Has 4 wings, 2 for travel and 2 for
swiftly changing plains. Hunts down pillagers and
rapists between planes. It's believed to be archnemesis and also a relative of Rothareron.
Dath: First things first, it's believed that the
modern word “death” has its name after him. No
one knows his reasoning because no one speaks
his language. He is Kraken-sized and walks in
oceans, even underwater. Whenever he comes
across the land he kills everything on his way
until he comes across another sea. Some believe
he is searching for someone with ginger hair.
Jotlyn: Great gambler. Dresses as a jester/clown.
He makes your wish come true for a price. If you
are between death and asking something from
him; we suggest you choose death. If you are
between asking something from him and making
a wish; we suggest you choose death.
Madame Chuye: She refused to be the wife of a
god and now she is cursed to never be wed
forever. Traveling mostly heavens looking for her
other half. Refused the hands of Jotlyn,
Rothareron, and Akalea in marriage. All
information about her is from people who have
been raised from dead after at least a dozen
years so it's believed she visits each plane every
dozen years (time measured in Teothe).
Qtuyoeggg: Tricked Akalea into praying for her
and is believed to be immortal. Lurks waiting for
humanity and all the entities to fade away from
existence and then to rule it all.
Sarguul: Travels planes looking for specific
ingredients. When asked what he is making,

Kraken attacking a city because he needed an
adrenaline-filled Kraken Tentacle to decorate his
plate better.
