        "Beware that there are a lot of 2e 3e 4e mixed in the above information._Goliaths of Teothe often lived in the colder regions, where lands mixed of Dwarves and Humans provided grounds for settlements. They were lead in by Pyraq, a goliath shaman. Pyraq had a shrine in Chapion that is lost to the plague in the northernmost lands. It was a stone niche enshrining an idol of Pyraq. Pyraq also embarked on a quest to help Goliaths escape their roots of tribal nature, which they failed. Many Goliaths still live in the 'dead-zone' area up north, and they long for their beloved shaman's shrine as Pyraq was known as Teothe's Sunspeaker.",
      description:
        "Goliaths were massive. They averaged between 2 to 2.5 meters, making them even taller than dragonborn and half-orcs. Goliath eyes were often a bright blue or green and sometimes glowed a little with an unusual supraorbital ridges. Their skin is often gray or brown and though, resembling stone, with black and vertically symmetrical patches covering their whole body. They believe that these markings somehow explain their fate or destiny. For this reason Goliaths never tattoo themselves._Goliaths' most notable characteristic was their competitiveness. They kept track of their accomplishments and saw everything as a challenge. Those not familiar with goliath psychology would often get annoyed when goliaths constantly reminded them how many times a certain thing had happened, thinking them arrogant or self-centered. To them, score keeping is a natural part of life. Beating their own records was the most satisfying victory for a goliath. They were also competitive with their companions and other goliaths, but were never arrogant or cocky. Goliaths had little time for cheaters, gloaters, and sore losers._It was rare for goliath adventurers to retire or live to an old age, as they often died trying to surpass their previous achievements. Permanently injured or aging goliaths often sought death in battle rather than succumb to an existence where they could not excel. This tradition of honor and trust meant that goliaths tended to be good overall. This combined with their competitive nature often led goliaths to valorous heroics. Goliaths were also notably daring and fearless. Feats of physical strength and agility, like jumping chasms or climbing cliffs, held no fear for goliaths._Complacency was a trait that goliaths loathed and as a result they never took anything for granted. Even goliaths with magical advantages would continue to train their physical prowess in case they ever lost their power. Goliath tribes only went to war as a final option, preferring to move away from unsafe lands. They did not do this out of fear or cowardice, instead they were aware that loss of life in their tribe was undesirable and had long-term consequences._Goliaths often employed guerrilla tactics in battle, owing to their upbringing as hunters. Fair-play was also integral to goliath fights. As long as they were fairly sure they could still win, goliaths would even handicap themselves to give their opponents a fair chance. For example, if a goliath disarmed their opponent, they would throw aside their own weapon and continue the fight with their fists._Goliaths lived in small tribes that numbered between forty and sixty goliaths. This was usually made up of three to five extended families. Most goliaths lived in the same tribe their entire life. On rare occasions, a tribe that got too large would split into smaller tribes or smaller tribes would merge together. Their tribes have roles such as: Chieftain, Captain, Skywatcher, Dawncaller, Adjudicator, Tent-mother, Lamentor._Tribe chieftains only maintained power as long as they could prove they were suitable for that role. As a result, leadership constantly changed. New leaders were chosen by contests. Any goliath could challenge the chieftain in an attempt to replace them. If this happened, the chieftain and the challenger competed in three tasks. The challenger had to win all three to become the new chieftain. The old chieftain would then leave the tribe permanently. Their camps are usually located on the mountains._Although goliaths had no written laws or codes, there were a number of unspoken rules that were commonly followed by most goliath tribes, discouraging theft and cheating. The greatest rule was obedience to the chieftain and captains. Those were usually punished by beating, shunning or even exiling._Goliaths had little empathy or pity for adults who couldn't take care of themselves but they would treat and take care of the injured and sick. Permanently injured goliaths were still expected to contribute in every way that they could. Arts and crafting in goliath culture were limited by the resources they had at hand in the mountains. As a result, goliaths were skilled in crafts like flintknapping, tanning, stitching, creating simple pottery, bone-carving, and painting. Art was one of the few things that goliaths understood to be non-competitive, they fully appreciated that art couldn't have a winner. Considering their competitive nature, it's not surprising that sports were often played by goliaths to improve their physical skills and pass time. Simple games included climbing, sprinting, and wrestling._They spoke Gol-Kaa and it was around for over a toushand years. Gol-Kaa was spoken in the active voice almost exclusively. It was grammatically torturous to use passive voice. Over time, many Goliaths learned to speak Giant and Common._Most goliath tribes revered nature and the primal forces. Goliath shamans were known as 'skywatchers' or 'sunspeakers'. Despite this some goliaths did worship or honor gods._Goliaths were friendly to anyone who didn't threaten their tribe, but wouldn't wait around for travelers who couldn't keep up with them. Goliaths were particularly fond of dwarves and had great respect for dwarven blacksmiths. Some goliaths would even venture into mountain tunnels to seek out dwarves. Human rangers or druids were known to sometimes work together with goliath tribes in hunts. Both the humans and goliaths could mutually benefit from these temporary alliances. Goliaths often referred to earth genasi as their 'cousins'. The two species maintained a friendly rivalry. Elves were somewhat intimidating to goliaths, owing to their long lifespans. Goliaths often struggled with the idea that creatures existed that were old enough to have known their great-grandparents and ancestors. Although they had no particular hatred of goblins, orcs, or half-orcs, goliaths were wary of them. This was mostly due to the stories that they heard from passing travelers about the trouble they caused. Attitudes towards giants varied._Goliaths who ventured out of their tribes would often find issue with the class divisions found in other societies. Goliaths struggled with the idea that an incompetent king could rule over hard-working peasants. These opinions were often shared and goliaths would openly mock incapable leaders or rich nobleman who relied on social structures to maintain their power._It's unclear how old the goliath species was or where they originally came from, but it was commonly believed that they were somehow related to stone giants or earth genasi.",

        "Deep gnomes, or svirfneblin, are natives of the Underdark and are suffused with that subterranean realm's magic. They can supernaturally camouflage themselves, and their svirfneblin magic renders them difficult to locate. These abilities have enabled them to survive for generations among the perils of the Underdark. Guarded, and suspicious of outsiders, svirfneblin are cunning and taciturn, but can be just as kind-hearted, loyal, and compassionate as their surface cousins._Svirfneblin seem more like creatures of stone than flesh. Their leathery skin is usually a gray, brown, or dun hue that acts as a natural camouflage with the rock around them. Their bodies are gnarled with hard muscle or fat, and they are heavier than their small stature suggests; svirfneblin often weigh 100 pounds or more but rarely stand much more than 3 feet tall._Male svirfneblin are bald from early childhood, although adults can grow stiff beards or mustaches. Females have full heads of hair, and they usually tie their hair back in braids or cut it short to keep it from getting in their way as they work._Svirfneblin are well adapted for their subterranean existence. They have excellent darkvision, and many of them have magical talents that rival the innate spellcasting of the drow and duergar. They are surprisingly strong for their size, enduring toil and danger that would overwhelm most other people._Despite their guarded natures, svirfneblin aren't joyless. They admire skillful work and delicate craftsmanship, just like any other gnome. Svirfneblin love gemstones of all kinds, and they boldly seek out precious stones in the deepest and darkest tunnels. They are also expert gemcutters and miners, and they prize rubies above all other gemstones._Svirfneblin are known as deep gnomes because they choose to live far below the earth's surface. Most svirfneblin never see the light of day. Their homes are well-hidden strongholds concealed by mazelike passages and clever illusions. Vast networks of mine tunnels ring most svirfneblin settlements, guarded by deadly traps and concealed sentries. Once a traveler passes through the outer defenses, the tunnels open up into marvelous cavern-towns carved from the surrounding rock with exquisite care. The svirfneblin are austere in their comforts compared to their surface cousins, but they take great pride in their stonework._Deep gnomes do their best to remain hidden. Even if surface travelers succeed in locating a svirfneblin community, winning their trust can be even more difficult. Those rare travelers who do succeed in befriending deep gnomes find that they are loyal and courageous allies against any foe._Because of this, the svirfneblin that dwell here are much more distrusting and wary than their kin on other worlds. Rarely do they allow strangers within their midst, and those that they must deal with are kept at arms length. If one is lucky enough to be trusted by the deep gnomes, they are a friend for life. For the svirfneblin of the Underdark, genuine trust is a commodity far more valuable than gold._By comparison to the surface dwelling gnomes, most svirfneblin possess very little wanderlust and rarely travel far from home. They see the surface world as a bewildering place without boundaries and filled with unknown dangers. Nevertheless, a few svirfneblin understand that it is necessary to know something about what is happening on the surface near their hidden refuges. As a result, some svirfneblin become scouts, spies, or messengers who venture abroad, doing their best to avoid attention. These travelers are notoriously close-mouthed about where they come from and what they are up to, but a few eventually learn to trust good-hearted people of the surface world._A few svirfneblin become merchants who deal with other species both above and below ground. Drow, duergar, and other peoples know that svirfneblin are usually neutral in outlook and typically honest in their dealings. Serving as middlemen between species too hostile to deal with each other directly can be lucrative, and it serves an important defensive function; svirfneblin middlemen tend to know more about rumors and threats between rival merchants than anybody else._Like other gnomes, deep gnomes can live for centuries, up to 500 years.",

        "The child of an elemental creature with a human was a half-elemental. The child of a half-elemental and a human was a genasi.

However, every few generations, a child might display his or her elemental heritage as a genasi. Para-genasi came about when a half-elemental of one type mated with an elemental creature of another type._Para-genasi were genasi who expressed a bloodline of two elements.

Some could pass as normal humans, bearing the marks of their human ethnicity. For others, their elemental nature was impossible to hide. Their heritage was nearly always evident in one or two physical traits, such as skin or hair color or an elemental aura._A rare few genasi could control two elemental manifestations simultaneously. These powerful entities were known as elemental tempests._Unlike many planetouched species, genasi generally took pride in their unusual features. Furthermore, because of their elemental power, most genasi felt a sense of superiority over other species and even over other genasi._Genasi artisans often saw their craft as a means of obtaining prestige. These individuals desired nothing more than to be in high demand and so worked hard to please their customer base. For this reason, many genasi often substituted actual excellence for customization and individuality and while the average genasi swordsmith might not compare with his dwarven counterpart in terms of quality, the genasi would work much harder to tailor the blade to his or her customer's specific needs and wants. This could go so far as to make genasi-crafted items seem uncomfortable or unwieldy in the hands of those for whom they were not intended.",

Shifters resembled humans, their close brethren, but with distinctively bestial features such as sharp teeth, claws, pointed ears, or fur. However, to a human's eye, the resemblance was less obvious than the differences. Unlike humans, shifters had flat, animal-like noses, larger than usual eyes that allowed them to see better in low light, heavy eyebrows, pointed ears, skin that was often of a brownish shade, and much more hair, also commonly brown, than was typical for the common human._Shifters lived to about as long humans did on average. Shifters were commonly self-reliant and free-spirited. However, they were restrained in their actions by a fear that they might become lost in the savagery that dwelled in their blood. However, this feral predatory nature could be to the shifter's advantage, and they made excellent rangers or druids._Most shifters resemble a particular kind of lycanthrope. Therefore, Shifters were often feared wherever they went, much like their lycanthrope ancestors. This was due to a common misconception that all lycanthropes were invariably and irreversibly evil, including shifters. While a shifter's appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral._Instead, shifters preferred either a nomadic lifestyle or living close to the edges of society, supporting it as fishers, trackers, hunters, guides, or scouts._Shifters favored gods of nature, the moon, and primal strength. Just like lycanthropes, shifters could be found scattered throughout, but only a few gathered in larger communities._While they form powerful bonds to friends and kin, shifters place great value on self-reliance and freedom. It's a shifter proverb to 'always be prepared for the journey yet to come' and most shifters strive to be ready for change or opportunity. Shifters have a natural inclination toward classes with a primal connection. A shifter barbarian draws their rage from the beast within. A shifter ranger indulges their urge to wander and hunt.

They speak in casual absolutes - right and wrong, virtue and depravity - leading some to wonder whether the loxodon mind can even perceive subtle shades of grey. Debate with a loxodon therefore borders on uselessness: their minds are made up quickly, and no amount of discussion will alter their path; and they will bring their full bulk and prowess in combat to uphold even a newly formed opinion. Matters of loxodon rules and religion, known collectively as the Modest Truth, are passed from generation to generation, and accepted with seemingly little deliberation._Loxodons are naturally confident, almost naively so; they regard any challenge as an opportunity to test themselves, prevail, and prove their personal skill. Their inbuilt armament and natural ability with weapons gives them good odds against any threat, and leads to an almost unbreakable resolve toward challenges in general. Their plans and strategies toward these challenges can be simplistic at times; as they can't (or choose not to) see the intricacies and details of a problem that some other species perceive, loxodons tend to favor a head-on, even brute-force approach to succeed in any situation. Many loxodons go out of their way to seek out difficulty and strife, believing that any chance to test their will and virtue is a gift._Despite their unwavering reliability, loxodons have elaborate measures of punishment for those who break the rules. First a ranking soldier or cleric dispenses a physical assault, overwhelming the violator with bodily pain; then a cleric or confessor hears the penitent's admission of guilt. This process works well among loxodons, ensuring a strict form of justice and guaranteeing consent on the Modest Truth, but other species often consider it barbaric or cruel._Loxodons resolve most problems with physical might, but when the need for spellcraft arises, their magic is direct, unambiguous, and crushingly forceful.

They are irrepressibly confident, seeing almost every event in their lives either as positive or as a challenging opportunity to prove their mettle.

The arrival of their offspring holds great importance, but it is in the presence of their special one that Kenku find true joy. Among the most delightful sights for a Kenku is the playful act of intertwining their legs and rolling about in mirth. To a Kenku, this intimate connection surpasses the exhilaration of flight, filling their hearts with a bliss unmatched by any other experience._They reproduce as large birds did, with the females laying clutches of two to four eggs that hatched after a period of two months. After hatching from their eggs, kenku remained in their home-nests with their families. Once they reached adulthood at age nine, they left their nests forever. At this point, they began to learn their disguise, thieving, and battle skills. Unwilling to travel alone, most soon banded together with other young adult kenku of similar habits for mutual protection and profit, forming new flocks. A few made their way on their own or formed partnerships with other creatures who needed their services. Kenku had had an omnivorous diet and could be active day and night._Kenku that are in Shadowfell are usually hired as spies, assassins, or enforcers, carrying out the will of dark beings or sinister organizations that operate within the plane. Their natural affinity for thievery and mimicry make them adept infiltrators and information gatherers within the Shadowfell. They are also drawn to the Shadowfell in their pursuit of arcane secrets and forbidden lore. Kenku delve into ancient libraries in order to research dark magic.",

Feathered folk who resemble ravens, kenku are blessed with keen observation and supernaturally accurate memories. None of them can remember the origin of the first kenku, however, and they often joke that there are as many kenku origin stories as there are kenku. Some of them paint their genesis as a curse, being a flightless bird people doomed to mimic other people's creations. Other kenku recite cryptic but beautiful poems about their advent being a blessed event in which they were sent into the multiverse to observe and catalog its many wonders. Kenku are most often found in the Shadowfell and the Material Plane, and they tend to have the coloration typical of ravens._Above all else, kenku wish to regain their ability to fly. Every kenku is born with a desire to take to the air, and those who learn spellcasting do so in hope of mastering spells that will allow them to fly. Rumors of magic items such as flying carpets, brooms capable of flight, and similar objects provoke a great desire for the kenku to acquire the items for themselves._Despite their lack of wings, kenku love dwelling in towers and other tall structures. They seek out ruins that reach to the sky, though they lack the motivation and creativity to make repairs or fortify such places. Even so, their light weight and size allow them to dwell in rickety structures that would collapse beneath a human or an orc._Although unable to speak in their own voices, kenku can perfectly mimic any sound they hear, from a halfling's voice to the noise of rocks clattering down a hillside. However, kenku cannot create new sounds and can communicate only by using sounds they have heard. Most kenku use a combination of overheard phrases and sound effects to convey their ideas and thoughts._As a result of their lack of creativity, kenku function comfortably as minions of a powerful master. Kenku gather in groups called flocks. A flock is led by the oldest and most experienced kenku with the widest store of knowledge to draw on, often called Master. Flock leaders enforce discipline and minimize conflicts, but they fail at effective planning or crafting longterm schemes._By the same token, kenku have no ability to invent new ideas or create new things. Kenku can copy existing items with exceptional skill, allowing them to become excellent artisans and scribes. They can copy books, make replicas of objects, and otherwise thrive in situations where they can produce large numbers of identical items. Few kenku find this work satisfying, since their quest for the freedom of flight makes them ill-suited to settle into a routine._Although kenku can't create new things, they have a talent for learning and memorizing details. Thus, ambitious kenku can excel as superb spies and scouts. A kenku who learns of clever schemes and plans devised by other creatures can put them to use. The kenku lack the talent to improvise or alter a plan, but a wise Master sets multiple plans in motion at once, confident that underlings can follow orders to the letter._For this reason, many kenku make an easy living serving as messengers, spies, and lookouts for thieves' guilds, bandits, and other criminal cartels. A network of kenku can relay a bird call or similar noise across the city, alerting their allies to the approach of a guard patrol or signaling a prime opportunity for a robbery. Some thieves' guilds use kenku as lookouts and messengers. The kenku dwell in the tallest buildings and towers the guild controls, allowing them to lurk in the highest levels and to keep watch on the city below._Since kenku can precisely reproduce any sound, the messages they carry rarely suffer degradation or shifts in meaning. Human messengers might switch words or phrases and garble a message inadvertently, but the kenku produce perfect copies of whatever they hear._Kenku adventurers are usually the survivors of a flock that has sustained heavy losses, or a rare kenku who has grown weary of a life of crime. These kenku are more ambitious and daring than their fellows. Others strike out on their own in search of the secrets of flight, to master magic, or to uncover the secret of their curse and find a method to break it. These Kenku adventurers, despite their relative independence, still have a tendency to seek out a companion to emulate and follow. A kenku loves to mimic the voice and words of its chosen companion._Given that kenku can duplicate any sound, their names are drawn from a staggering variety of noises and phrases. Kenku names tend to break down into three categories that make no distinction between male and female names._Kenku thugs, warriors, and toughs adopt noises made by weapons, such as the clang of a mace against armor or the sound made by a breaking bone. Non-kenku refer to the kenku by describing this noise. Examples of this type of name include Smasher, Clanger, Slicer, and Basher._Kenku thieves, con artists, and burglars adopt animal noises, typically those common in urban settings. In this manner, kenku can call out to each other while those who overhear them mistake them for common animals. Non-kenku use names that refer to the sound made or the animal a kenku mimics, such as Rat Scratch, Whistler, Mouser, and Growler._Some kenku turn their back on crime to pursue legitimate trades. These kenku adopt noises made as part of their craft. A sailor duplicates the sound of a fluttering sail, while a smith mimics the clanging of a hammer on metal. Non-kenku describe these folk by their trade sounds, such as Sail Snap, Hammerer, and Cutter.",

Halflings got along well with most of the other species and were known for their curiosity and tendency to collect things._Standing somewhere around 81-100 cm tall and weighing on average between 15kg, halflings are small compared to most other species. Most halflings had dark hair and eyes and nearly all male halflings were incapable of growing true beards, though many had long sideburns._Halflings were by nature joyful and friendly in their dealings with others. Halflings appeared deceptively harmless, meaning they were often beyond the notice of enemies that might otherwise pose a threat to them. The halfling mind was practical and halflings concerned themselves with their immediate surroundings. They took pleasure in simple things, with few aspiring to greatness in the same manner as humans._While many halflings did not have the ambition for adventure that some species did, most preferred trouble to boredom. Unfortunately, the small size of halflings have an effect on their abilities. Halflings were, for instance, incapable of wielding larger weapons like greatswords or halberds._Halfling communities were tightly knit groups found around the world, usually near the settlements of other species. Most halflings didn't recognize the claims of kings or nobles as sovereign rulers but instead looked primarily to their family elders to guide them. Halflings also valued a sense of community; halflings naming each other ''halfling'' was a salute of brotherhood. Most halflings, didn't live in communities of their own but instead regions dominated by other species. This was particularly true in human societies, which attracted halflings because of the comparative rapidity with which they changed. It should be noted that halflings usually found insults directed at them to be amusing rather than insulting._Halfling culture had a fondness for stories and legends and was rich in the oral tradition. So much care was put into the retelling of traditional stories and their preservation that halflings often unwittingly had access to lore about ancient and long-gone cultures or empires that others had long since forgotten about._The halfling species had many traditional homelands, though as a whole the species was typically nomadic. Over time, Halflings became more displaced than before, though as a result they also came together in unity even more tightly than they were before. Though formerly met with prejudice, halflings earned acceptance through their skill as merchants and business partners even though they were around as the same time as dwarves, elves, and giants._The hin generally avoided realms where slavery was prevalent or those where exploitation of their kind was socially acceptable.",

Male tortles experience an overwhelming urge they are unable to resist for long. In a bittersweet resolve, a sacred and celebrated act, the male Tortle selflessly offers his life to nurture the birth of his offspring. This sacrifice is revered rather than mourned by the Tortle community._Tortles lay their eggs (numbering as few as one or as many as a dozen) in a fortified compound enclosed by stone walls that are easily defensible. If no such compound exists, they build one. The female parent spend the remainder of their lives guarding the compound, defending their offspring, and sharing a lifetime of knowledge before they die. When the children are old enough to leave the compound, they pick up whatever weapons and tools their parents left behind and set out on their own.",

        "What many tortles consider a simple life, others might call a life of adventure. They are nomad survivalists eager to explore the wilderness._These turtle folk live on many worlds, most often journeying up and down coasts, along waterways, and across the sea. Tortles don't have a unified story of how they were created, but they all have a sense of being mystically connected to the natural world. Carrying their shelter on their backs gives tortles a special feeling of security wherever they go, for even if they visit a far, unknown country, they have a place to lay their heads._Tortles exhibit the same range of coloration and patterns found among turtles, and many tortles enjoy adorning their shells in distinctive ways._A tortle hatches from a thick-shelled egg and spends the first few weeks of its life crawling on all fours. Its parents, old and near death, spend what little time they have left telling stories to their offspring. Within a year, the young tortle becomes an orphan, though not before it learns to speak and to survive on its own._A young tortle and its siblings inherit whatever tools, weapons, and gifts their parents left behind. Each young tortle is expected to fend for itself. It leaves the place of its birth and finds its own corner of the wilderness in which to hunt, catch fish, and get by. With each passing year, a tortle hones its survival skills. It forms friendships with its neighbors while also respecting their privacy. At some point, a tortle feels an almost overwhelming urge to venture far away from home and see more of the world. It gathers up its possessions and heads into the wilderness, returning months or years later with stories of its exploits and new skills._Tortles don't have their own pantheon of gods, but they often worship the gods of other species. It's not unusual for a tortle to hear stories or legends related to a god and choose to worship that deity. Tortles are often drawn to the Gods of Good, among the deities, Ehx, Cyaxo, Nmei and Boghradyn relate to tortles most._Tortles believe that night and day watch over them and other creatures. The moon is the eye of night that watches over them in darkness, and the sun is the equally vigilant eye of day. Tortles feel most at peace when one or both of these 'eyes' are looking down on them. They become more nervous and uneasy when neither orb is visible in the sky. Tortles tend to be most uncomfortable underground, where neither the sun nor the moon is visible to them._Blessed are the days when both the sun and moon are visible in the sky at the same time. Tortles often choose such days to leave their homes and begin a wilderness expedition, or perform some other task they know to be dangerous._Tortles have a saying: 'We wear our homes on our backs.' The shells they carry around provide all the shelter they require. Consequently, tortles don't feel the need to root themselves in one place for too long. A tortle settlement is primarily used as a kind of moot, where tortles can socialize with one another, share useful information, and trade with strangers in the safety of greater numbers. Tortles don't regard these settlements as places worth defending with their lives, and they will abandon a settlement when it no longer serves their needs._Most tortles like to see how other creatures live and discover new customs and new ways of doing things. The urge to procreate doesn't kick in until the end of a tortle's life, and a tortle can spend decades away from its native land without feeling homesick._Tortles embrace a simple view of the world. It is a place of wonder, and tortles see beauty in the ordinary. They live for the chance to hear a soft wind blowing through palm trees, to watch a frog croaking on a lily pad, or to stand in a crowded human marketplace._Tortles like to learn new skills. They craft their own tools and weapons, and they are good at building structures and fortifications. They marvel at the works of other civilized creatures, humans in particular, and can lose themselves for years in a city, studying its architectural wonders and learning skills they can put to use when building forts to contain their offspring._Although they spend a considerable portion of their lives in isolation, tortles are social creatures that like to form meaningful friendships. They have no inbred animus toward people of other species. In fact, a tortle will often seek out friendships with non-tortles to learn new customs and new points of view._Tortles prefer simple, non-gender-specific names that are usually no more than two syllables. Tortles don't have surnames or family names. If a tortle doesn't like its name for whatever reason, it can change it. A tortle might change its name a dozen times in its life. Some examples include Baka, Damu, Gar, Gura, Ini, Jappa, Kinlek, Krull, Lim, Lop, Nortle, Nulka, Olo, Ploqwat, Quee, Queg, Quott, Steram, Sunny, Tibor, Ubo, Uhok, Wabu, Xelbuk, Xopa, Yog",

Even though they are short, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk._Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived species such as humans and halflings lack._Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf._Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud._Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can't find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other species are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them._Dwarves get along passably well with most other species. \u201cThe difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years,\u201d is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of a short-lived species like humans to earn a dwarf's trust.",

Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome's insatiable interest in everything around. As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life._Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly puns and pranks, they're just as dedicated to the more serious tasks they undertake. Many gnomes are skilled engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors. They're willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in the process of perfecting what they do. Gnomes speak as if they can't get the thoughts out of their heads fast enough.

Their homes are well hidden by both clever construction and simple illusions. Gnomes who settle in human lands are commonly gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkers.

Extremely powerful and durable, warforged were able fighters. Unlike most constructs, warforged were fully self-aware and maintained mental faculties on par with elves, humans, or similar species. The most important marking for any warforged was their 'truth', a rune distinctive to each warforged which was placed upon their forehead._Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed. Although they were manufactured, warforged are living humanoids. Resting, healing magic, and the Medicine skill all provide the same benefits to warforged that they do to other humanoids._They are sexless and incapable of reproduction. The warforged's artificial nature also gave the species a unique relationship to pain, which seemed limited to actual injury. This allowed warforged to modify themselves with some ease, giving them a varied appearance in spite of their lack of inherent biological diversity._Warforged's artificial nature also meant they did not need to eat, drink, or breathe. Likewise, warforged did not need to sleep but did nonetheless require rest in a fully-aware state for a period of at least four hours._Warforged took their name from their original purpose, as soldiers, and many had a dutiful attitude towards life, taking pleasure from fulfilling commands. Warforged as a whole had a strong work ethic and shared an aversion to failure. Warforged were capable of fear, often of death or pain, as much as other species and could come to hate the sources of these fears just as easily. Warforged were also capable of loyalty and joy, particularly in relations to friends and allies and could be driven to anger when their loves or goals were threatened. However, warforged as a whole exhibited a simple-minded and reserved approach to life with straightforward goals and reactionary passions._Since warforged were created in a state of physical maturity, many exhibited a childlike perspective that was often mistaken as na\u00efve or emotionally crippled; this was not necessarily true. Some warforged, in fact, developed a particularly sophisticated view of the world, ever curious about its mysteries in part due to the odd nature of their creation. Many wondered where they might go in death and if they even have souls. Some created deeply ordered philosophies to govern themselves or maintained a perpetual list of tasks to occupy themselves with. Others fell in with the religions and mindsets of other species.
