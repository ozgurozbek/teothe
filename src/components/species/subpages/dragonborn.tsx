Because of thousands of years of interbreeding, the scales a dragonborn wore were scarlet, gold, rust, ochre, bronze, or brown in hue, though a few dragonborn with an stronger draconic heritage had scales resembling those of true dragons. Like dragons, dragonborn were often mistaken for reptiles, but were in fact warm-blooded draconic creatures.",
