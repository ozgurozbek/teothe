                  "Half-elves inherit a blend of of physical traits from their human and elven ancestors, and they are typically good-looking. Elves consider half-elves to resemble humans and sometimes call them ''half-humans'', while humans consider them to resemble elves. Male half-elves are distinguished from their elven ancestors by the ability to grow facial hair. Half-elves can inherit facial features and hair, eye and skin color of either parent, though it is common for them to inherit their eyes from the elven parent.",
                  "Half-elves are uncommon in most worlds, where humans and elves tend to live apart. Half-elves prefer the company of half-elves, but typically integrate into human societies and have no distinct kingdoms of their own. Many half-elves take up life as a wanderer, feeling that they do not truly fit into either human or elven culture, and often outliving human companions.",

                  "In the year 271 DC, a figure named Virimelle emerged, believed to be either a debated avatar of the Elven deity Yr''snn or a brainwashed avatar of Guulagh. Their purpose was to preserve and purify elven blood, leading to a violent quest that involved the killing of half-elves and occasionally humans.",
                  "Rumors spread regarding Virimelle's fate. Some claim they ascended to a higher state, while others believe they were banished to Teothe's Alean's Grave. There are even whispers that Virimelle emerged victorious in their conquest against the Divine and now poses a threat to all half-elves. Mentioning the name Virimelle alongside half-elves is a sensitive topic to be avoided.",
                  "During this tumultuous period, there were fanatical elves who supported Virimelle's mission, further adding to the complexity of the situation. A half-elf summarizes this as a dark chapter in history marked by the rise of Virimelle, their violent crusade against half-elves and humans, and the uncertainty surrounding their ultimate fate and the implications for the half-elf community.",
