# TODO

## 1.3

- [ ] When minimized, sidenav always shows the tab name after clicking it
- [ ] When minimized and landscape, sidenav does not fit the screen
- [ ] 6 more races to backend (Decide which ones. We should finish SRD and PHB first)
- [ ] PWA (Web app manifest or service worker do not meet the installability requirements, Failures: No manifest was fetched.)
- [ ] Deities images use image in avatar, need to have square deity images
- [ ] When the top sidenav image is clicked, sidenav still keeps active tab
- [ ] CalendarTable responsive cell coloring idea bounce (probably needs a bit of a rewrite based on some responsive conditions or cellnumber == even type stuff) (I think giving each cell a border and fixing their background color is easier. I don't want it to turn more into a spaghetti)
- [x] Improve page title, too short + single word
- [ ] next-size-adjust meta tag - needs testing
- [x] more words in the main page, maybe we can provide a campaign setting text
- [ ] share on discord button would be nice
- [ ] more internal links, lets redirect each button to its page if you want instead of rendering all in some content area, so not a Single Page App
- [ ] Fix homebrews page to fetch only once.
- [x] Robots.txt

## 1.2

- [x] Function comment coverage - is its own branch
- [x] Some thematic background for the main page
- [x] rgba instead of 8 digit HEX colouring
- [x] Races page responsive (sm screen)
- [x] Page Top scroll smooth tailwind

- [x] CalendarCell.tsx scroll
- [x] calendar year input css
- [x] PageCalendar onchange

- [-] Map zoom idea bounce

## 1.1

- [x] Planes wheel update to show holes\*

- [-] Layout>hasSider(bool): Whether contain Sider in children, don't have to assign it normally. Useful in ssr avoid style flickering

## Release

- [x] Map descriptions: There is no easy way of doing this simply without changing page layout. I mean, it is for the best as the DM should describe them, it'd be bad if the map described itself. Some exceptions have their icons changed and now use tooltips.
- [x] Fill races table (BE): Not all of them, most common and basic ones are fine.
- [x] Mobile: library css things - This worked fine?
- [x] Library page looks improved
- [x] Races pages Homebrew switch has the same color when On and Off
- [x] Delete Quest Page
- [x] Antd Loading..
- [x] Move backend into pythonanywhere
- [x] Compile and move FE build to github pages
