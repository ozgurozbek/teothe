## We developed the Codex feature for a very simple reason

If you're diving into the Teothe campaign setting now, imagine having a codex full of lore, characters, and history right at your fingertips. A publicly available codex would allow you to quickly reference the world’s key details and immerse yourself even deeper into the story. These details doesn't have to be canonical, but as long as they spark some creativity, we are pleased.

For players, it’s a great way to enrich your character’s backstory and decisions with a solid understanding of Teothe’s cultures and traditions. No more guessing, just direct access to the information you need to enhance your roleplaying. Most of it is already available with your DM, and other resources on the website. This could very well be the last drop needed for your next character idea!

For game masters, a codex provides a short, simple and quick way to help you enrich your world-building. It can help you keep your narrative tight and full of depth, with plenty of inspiration for quests and encounters.

And for us, as Teothe team. We love creative writing, and we thought that this is a neat idea to bring some characters, world-building, and stories into life. Our goal was to create a resource that helps players and GMs fully experience the setting, encouraging deeper engagement and creativity. By sharing this knowledge, we’re making the world of Teothe more alive and connected for all.

In short, a codex brings Teothe to life, making it easier for everyone to jump in and enjoy.

And we love the idea.
